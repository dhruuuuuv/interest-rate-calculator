## Interest Accumulator Web-app
See how much your interest can accumulate over time!
Simple web-app (KISS applies), to show the benefits of regular saving, early!

## Python & Django setup

* Install `python3` via brew
* Clone the repo
* cd into repo
* Install `virtualenv` using `pip3` (think yarn)

```sh
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```

* Create a virtualenv for the project

```sh
virtualenv -p python3 venv
```

If you're having trouble completing this step, try upgrading virtualenv first `pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv`

* Activate the virtualenv

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

* Install dependencies in the new virtualenv

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

* Server should be running at http://localhost:8000


 ## Client setup

 * cd into `frontend` and run `yarn install`

 * Run `yarn start`. 

The webapp should now be running at http://localhost:3000 🚀
